*GREETING*

`-☆ Hello there! As seen from the information above my name is Bridget! Nicknames are typically for friends only but do what you will! I got by she/they pronouns and I really, REALLY like music! I tend to get fixated on fandoms purely because of my ocs, so you'll see me [for ponytown users] more often than not in an oc skin!`

‹𝟹*To clear up some possible altercations in the future, let me establish boundies.*

**DNI**:

*PEDOPHILES .., ZOOPHILES .., SEXISTS .., DARKSHIPPERS .., ISLAMAPHOBES .., HOMOPHOBES .., ETC* **[ Instantly. Out of my sight. ]**

*PUSHY PEOPLE* **[ I can take it light-heartedly as in a joking way, but if you keep trying to make me do things which I cannot/do not want to do I will obviously distance from you and unfriend or even block you ]**

*TROLLS* **[ Eh. Do what you will. I always end up ignoring, joking around with, or blocking these people. But don't 'troll' people with sensitive topics such as ab---e or r--- (this has happened)]**

**IWC**:

*PEOPLE WHO GET VERY VERY ATTACHED EASILY* **[ I will be there for you as a friend, but at times I can distance myself from people and come back once in a while or randomly come back again. I have yet to figure out why I'm like this but if we meet consistently I may start to come to you as a habit! I do message all my friends who I know ]**
