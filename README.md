⤷ ゛DISLIKES:Honestly, I don't like people who make 'jokes' about S/A or gr00ming targetted towards the victims. It's not funny and you are on my DNI list. Also those who don't know what BOUNDARIES are - hello? They exist for a reason? If I don't like something or I'm uncomfortable with something doesn't mean you should try to 'change my view' or force me into doing something. Get away from me if you're like this /srs. On a lighter note, I dislike being spammed multiple times; this mostly applies to strangers so please be aware! With friends it's fine. Please also don't bring up triggering topics wihtout a warning around me, it makes me uncomfortable and confused on what to do, so please give a warning beforehand..ˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛FAVORITE SONGS:'THIS WILL MAKE YOU LOVE AGAIN - IAMX' / 'YOU LOVE ME - KIMYA DAWSON' / 'HAVE FAITH, HORATIO - CHASE PETRA' / 'NOT ALLOWED - TV GIRL' / 'BLUE HAIR - TV GIRL' / 'CIGARETTES OUT THE WINDOW - TV GIRL' / 'METEOR SHOWER - CAVETOWN' / 'TREEHOUSE - CAVETOWN' / 'DEVIL TOWN - CAVETOWN' / 'BOYS WILL BE BUGS - CAVETOWN' / 'SIMPLE SONG - SUSHI SOUCY' / 'DEEP BREATHS - SUSHI SOUCY' / 'GOD MUST HATE ME - CATIE TURNER'ˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛FANDOMS:HARRY POTTER [No I do not support JK Rowling. I get my things second-hand] ~ FORSAKEN [Getting into it just now due to oomfs] ~ THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS ~ EPIC THE MUSICAL [I have no say in the controversey. I have my views, you have yours.] ~ TRANSFORMERSˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛WARNING:Please, please, and yet another please, tell me if I am making you uncomfortable. I do not mean it intentionally and I know my humor may be weird when I soften up around you, so tell me if you're not feeling okay with my mannerisms. I'm also sensitive towards friends, so if I have a feeling you don't like me or find me annoying, I may begin to distance from you, but this is mostly due to the fact I think you need space. When I'm engrossed in a certain topic I may talk a LOT so tell me if it's overwhelming. As mentioned above, with triggering topics give a warning please, not like a stressful day or you tripped and fell, but topics such as S/A, S/H, or anything similar. Or at least just tell me what you're going to say may be negative or indicate it.ˎˊ˗
