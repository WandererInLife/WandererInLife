⤷ ゛PRONNOUNS:She/Theyˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛DNI:Homophobes, Pedophiles, Zoophiles, Ableists, Sexists, etc, etc. Basic Dni Criteriaˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛LIKES:I generally like reading and drawing. I yap about my ocs if I feel like I trust you/if the topic is brought up! I love my ocs, and if you're uncomfy with me talking too much tell me! ^-^ I also love cottagecore and music, mainly alternate music. I LOVE Cavetown and Tv Girl!!!ˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛DISLIKES;Honestly, I don't like people who make 'jokes' about S/A or gr00ming targetted towards the victims. It's not funny and you are on my DNI list. Also those who don't know what BOUNDARIES are - hello? They exist for a reason? If I don't like something or I'm uncomfortable with something doesn't mean you should try to 'change my view' or force me into doing something. Get away from me if you're like this /srs. On a lighter note, I dislike being spammed multiple times; this mostly applies to strangers so please be aware! With friends it's fine.ˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛FAVORITE SONGS:'THIS WILL MAKE YOU LOVE AGAIN - IAMX' / 'YOU LOVE ME - KIMYA DAWSON' / 'HAVE FAITH, HORATIO - CHASE PETRA' / 'NOT ALLOWED - TV GIRL' / 'BLUE HAIR - TV GIRL' / 'CIGARETTES OUT THE WINDOW - TV GIRL' / 'METEOR SHOWER - CAVETOWN' / 'TREEHOUSE - CAVETOWN' / 'DEVIL TOWN - CAVETOWN' / 'BOYS WILL BE BUGS - CAVETOWN' / 'SIMPLE SONG - SUSHI SOUCY' / 'DEEP BREATHS - SUSHI SOUCY' / 'GOD MUST HATE ME - CATIE TURNER'ˎˊ˗

⤷ ゛ADVISED:Please, please, and yet another please, tell me if I am making you uncomfortable. I do not mean it intentionally and I know my humor may be weird when I soften up around you, so tell me if you're uncomfortable. I'm also sensitive towards friends, so if I have a feeling you don't like me or find me annoying, I may begin to distance from you.ˎˊ˗
