# `❀˖° BRIDGET'S COVE ❀˖°`

𓂃. HELLO! I'm Bridget or Wanderer for my fellow Ponytowners!!! I'm usually in the Transformers or Hazbin Hotel Area - or you'll find me around the Bakery or Docks. Usually I either stay put in one spot with my friends or I'm wandering the map. I tend to walk around a lot in game when I'm aimless. C+H available most of the time !!! I love making friends but can be quite awkward at first - usually Im in one of my ocs skins because I LOVE making ocs. Sometimes I can yap a lot or be very quiet - usually when I'm tired. Below are some things you should know about me!

[Heavily serious, but hate me, like me, or don't give a damn about me, don't go after my friends for a problem between you and me. It remains BETWEEN US so don't stress out my friends with our bullshit.]

# `୨୧ THINGS ABOUT ME ୨୧` 

- Usually friends call me Bridget, but some nicknames you can use are Wanderer or Wand - some call me Traveler or Trav because of my Discord username ! XD

- I go by she/her and they/them! I don't mind.

- My most prominent focus in fandoms is on the Harry Potter, Hazbin Hotel and Warrior Cats. Following strongly is Hamilton the Musical, Epic the Musical and Transformers !!!

- I love commentary and documentaries - especially if it's on horror! I love putting it as my background noise when playing Ponytown ^-^

- I can grow distant from you if we don't interact often - but I'm up for conversations from time to time! I like all my friends :p

# `⏔₊⊹ CAREFUL INFORMATION ₊⊹⏔`

- Sometimes I can tend to multitask so I might not see your messages - please whisper me if I don't respond! If you do whisper me and I don't respond I might be doing something offtab or, a more funny alternative, I'm lazy - I'll go up to you and boop you if I'm lazy but if I'm offtab I won't do anything!

- I'm not sure about my emotions at time... I don't exactly know what I feel sometimes but I will react with what I know is morally right.

- Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood I tend to not respond. There's no hard feelings it's just I feel irritated about something, usually after a fight or something I've seen. I'll start using the 'Busy' status when there's moments like this. Ponytown is a comfort game for me.

- At times or nearly ALL the time I LOVE sitting beside other people who have "C+H" in their name! If I make you feel uncomfortable, please inform me!

- Up to a good chat! Especially if I'm in crowded areas! I tend to lose things to talk about so usually you can take the lead with the conversation!
