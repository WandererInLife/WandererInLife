# `❀˖° BRIDGET'S COVE ❀˖°`

𓂃. HELLO! I'm Bridget or Wanderer for my fellow Ponytowners!!! I'm usually in the Transformers or Hazbin Hotel Area - or you'll find me around the bakery or docks. Usually I either stay put in one spot with my friends or I'm wandering the map. I tend to walk around a lot in game when I'm aimless. C+H available most of the time !!! I love making friends but can be quite awkward at first - usually Im in one of my ocs skins because I LOVE making ocs. Sometimes I can yap a lot or be very quiet - usually when I'm tired. Below are some things you should know about me!

# `୨୧ THINGS ABOUT ME ୨୧` 

- Usually friends call me Bridget, but some nicknames you can use are Wanderer or Wand - some call me Traveler or Trav because of my Discord username ! XD

- I go by she/her and they/them! I don't mind.

- My most prominent focus in fandoms is on the Harry Potter, Hazbin Hotel and Warrior Cats. Following strongly is Hamilton the Musical, Epic the Musical and Transformers !!!

- I love commentary and documentaries - especially if it's on horror! I love putting it as my background noise when playing Ponytown ^-^

- I can grow distant from you if we don't interact often - but I'm up for conversations from time to time! I like all my friends :p
